## Justification
This dataset was chosen to challenge ourselves and put to work the data visualization skills we’ve gathered throughout the class. 

## Description
In this project, we will try to answer questions related to the salary of players of different sports worldwide in an online dashboard. Our data set presents annual information related to nationality, salary, sport/discipline, current rank and last year rank. The technologies that we will be using include D3, Flask and PostgreSQL, to create a front-end visualization connected to a back-end server containing our database. We will also incorporate the jQuery library, which was not seen in class, to simplify the event handlers within our Javascript code. The dashboard will help us solve the following key questions:

## Key questions

Which is the highest paying sport?
Which country has the most top 10 paid athletes?
Is there a relationship between a player’s nationality and his salary?
Has the salary of sports players increased overtime since 1990?
